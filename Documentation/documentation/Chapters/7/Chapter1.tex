\section{Scope}

The system to be produced is a web application which is referred to as the system throughout the document. The development team is designing and building this system over the period of 10 weeks during autumn semester at the University of Wollongong. The development team consists of five students undertaking CSCI311, It is intended for the user to be able to import the raw data from the python.org repositories for mail, issues and source control, and then visualise and manipute the data. Whilst the user base is intended for developers working on the python system, the system is indented to be easy to use for a non-technical user and allow for the ease in understanding different information visualised in one software solution.
