\section{Objective 1}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Objective:} & The software is capable of retrieving the Python SVN data to store within a database \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Specific} & To allow the program to access to the locally stored data\\ \hline
        \textbf{Measurable} & To reduce the time it takes to load the data and avoiding constant connection to the SVN to find data. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Achievable} &  We have the tools and skills required to construct this functionality\\ \hline
        \textbf{Relevant} & Yes, the client specifies importing data as a requirement and is relevant for our software to be a success  \\ \hline
        \textbf{Time Constrained} & This should be completed within the first couple of weeks of development so we have time to implement other functionalities \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\subsection{Sub-Objectives}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Setup database
		\item Develop web scraper to find information within emails and bugs
		\item Implement scraper in final software to enable data import to the database
	\end{itemize}

\section{Objective 2}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Objective:} & The user can log in to the system and view relevant data relating to their profile \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Specific} & Give the user a better experience with the software as the data is personalised on the user logged in\\ \hline
        \textbf{Measurable} & To increase the number of people using the software as are left with a good experience \\ \hline
        \textbf{Achievable} &  It is achievable to construct a log in system and user profiles\\ \hline
        \textbf{Relevant} & Yes, the client specifies importing data as a requirement and is relevant for our software to be a success  \\ \hline
        \textbf{Time Constrained} & This should be achieved after data has been imported and to take about a week to implement (5th May) \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sub-Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User having an account on the system
		\item Query specific data based on the logged in user
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Analyse user and calculate source code contribution
		\end{itemize}
		\item Return data from DB showing user related data
	\end{itemize}

\section{Objective 3}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Objective:} & The user can view visualisations of bug reports and mail logs from the data stored in the database \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Specific} & To allow simple, clean and aesthetic viewing of meaningful data that the user queries\\ \hline
        \textbf{Measurable} & To encourage further use of the system as it is simple and visually aesthetic whilst providing the information needed\\ \hline
        \textbf{Achievable} &  It is achievable to create graphs and such to visualise the requested data by the user as we have the tools, skills and time required\\ \hline
        \textbf{Relevant} & Visualising the data to the user is a core requirement for the system  \\ \hline
        \textbf{Time Constrained} & This should be achieved after data has been imported and to take about a week to implement (5th May) \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sub-Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User Query to data that user is requesting
		\item Optimus accesses data from DB
		\item Optimus converts that data into graphs
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implement a visualisation tool to show graphs
	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}


\section{Objective 4}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Objective:} & The user can view statistics based on the data that is stored in the database \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Specific} & To provide additional use of the \\ \hline
        \textbf{Measurable} & To further satisify the user of the system as it is simple and visually aesthetic whilst providing the information needed\\ \hline
        \textbf{Achievable} &  The functionality is already implemented in the system from previous objectives\\ \hline
        \textbf{Relevant} & Aggregating the data stored in the data, this is also a system requirements  \\ \hline
        \textbf{Time Constrained} & Due to this relying on other project objectives this system needs to be completed by the 22nd of May \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sub-Objectives}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop code that allows the system to get relevant data from the database
		\item Data returned will be summarised
		\item Display data summary to the user
	\end{itemize}

\section{Objective 5}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Objective:} & A user (assuming they have permission) is able to manipulate the data stored in the database \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Specific} & To give flexibility to the data allowing the user to have more maniputate on the system\\ \hline
        \textbf{Measurable} & Customer satisfaction with product as they do not just view data, they can use it as a tool to edit data (handy for project managers)\\ \hline
        \textbf{Achievable} &  The functionality is already implemented in the system from previous objectives\\ \hline
        \textbf{Relevant} &  This was a feature requi \\ \hline

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sub-Objectives}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item User enters query which gets translated into a request for specific data from the DB
		\item The data is returned and user makes changes (resends new data)
		\item New data is inserted into database replacing the previous data.
	\end{itemize}
