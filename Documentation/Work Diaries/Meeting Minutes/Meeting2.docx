\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Meeting @ 25/03\

\b0 Looked into making it web based using the D3js tool for showing graphs/visualising the data in an aesthetic way to the user\
\
Swinging towards using javascript as D3js tool is in javascript so it makes sense to code it in the one language.\
\
Planning on having multiple users on program at once so MySQL > SQLlite.\
