Work Diaries for James

Week 1&2: not part of any group

Week 3: found group. We discussed the language to use for this project. 

It was decided that Ruby on Rails is the way to go. This is a new language for many of us, however we all feel that it will be an easy language to learn. 

Also worked out our group roles. My job will be to do the detailed plan. 

Week 4:

Couple of evening meetings. Canvassed ideas on how to tackle the data. Worked out some more details on Week 6 deliverables. 

Week 5: finalised all draft notes. My job is to get the detailed plan and objectives done.
