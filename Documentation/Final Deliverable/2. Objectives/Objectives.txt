Optimus Software will be regarded as a success if...

1 The software is capable of retrieving the Python SVN data to store within a database
	Specific			To allow the program to access to the locally stored data
	Measurable			To reduce the time it takes to load the data and avoiding constant connection to the SVN to find data.
	Achievable			We have the tools and skills required to construct this functionality
	Relevant			Yes, the client specifies importing data as a requirement and is relevant for our software to be a success
	Time Constrained	This should be completed within the first couple of weeks of development so we have time to implement other functionalities (27th April)

	"Import Python SVN data into a database by the 27th of April in order to speed up the way Optimus accesses the relevant data as it is stored locally rather than the SVN"

	To complete this requires...

	1.1 Setup database
	1.2 Develop web scraper to find information within emails and bugs
	1.3 Implement scraper in final software to enable data import to DB



2 The user can log in to the system and view relevant data relating to their profile
	Specific			Give the user a better experience with the software as the data is personalised on the user logged in
	Measurable			To increase the number of people using the software as are left with a good experience
	Achievable			It is achievable to construct a log in system and user profiles
	Relevant			Yes, the client wishes to have data relating to the current user easily accessible
	Time Constrained	This should be achieved after data has been imported and to take about a week to implement (5th May)

	Relevant data = Show mail, show activity, show outstanding

	To complete this requries... (assuming data has been imported, put as a pre-requisite)

	2.1 User having Optimus account
	2.2 Query specific data based on the logged in user
		2.2.1 Analyse user and calculate source code contribution
	2.3 Return data from DB showing user related data



3 The user can view visualisations of bug reports and mail logs from the data stored in the database
	Specific			To allow simple, clean and aesthetic viewing of meaningful data that the user queries
	Measurable			To encourage further use of Optimus as it is simple and visually aesthetic whilst providing the information needed
	Achievable			It is achievable to create graphs and such to visualise the requested data by the user as we have the tools, skills and time required
	Relevant			Visualising the data to the user is an integral part of what Optimus' purpose is
	Time Constrained	Completed by the 15th of May

	Visualisations = wordcloud, graphs

	To complete this requries... (assuming data has been imported, put as a prerequisite)

	3.1 User Query to data that user is requesting
	3.2 Optimus accesses data from DB
	3.3 Optimus converts that data into graphs
		3.3.1 Implement a visualisation tool to show graphs



4 The user can view statistics based on the data that is stored in the database
	Specific			To provide a deeper inside into the data that is stored
	Measurable			Increasers user satisfaction with the program
	Achievable			We have the tools and skills required to construct this functionality
	Relevant			Relevant as it shows summarys of meaningful data
	Time Constrained	Completed by the 22nd of May

	To complete this requries... (assuming data has been imported, put as a prerequisite)

	4.1 Develop code that allows Optimus to get relevant data from the database (for summaries)
	4.2 Data returned will be summarised
	4.3 Display data summary to the user
	


5 A user (with permission) is able to manipulate the data stored in the database
	Specific			To give flexibility to the data allowing the user to have more functionailty on Optimus
	Measurable			Customer satisfaction with product as they do not just view data, they can use it as a tool to edit data (handy for project managers)
	Achievable			We have the tools and skills required to construct this functionality
	Relevant			This s a requirement given by the client meaning it is neccesary to include within Optimus
	Time Constrained	Completed by the 22nd of May

	To complete this requries... (assuming data has been imported, put as a prerequisite)

	5.1 User enters query which gets translated into a request for specific data from the DB
	5.2 The data is returned and user makes changes (resends new data)
	5.3 New data is inserted into database replacing the previous data.
